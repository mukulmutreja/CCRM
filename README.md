## ‚ú® Main Things It Can Do

* **Student Management:** Add, update, remove, and search for student records.
* **Course Management:** Add, update, remove, and search for available courses.
* **Enrollment System:** Enroll students in courses, enforcing a maximum credit limit.
* **Grading:** Save student grades for courses and automatically calculate GPA.
* **Data Handling:** Import and export system data from/to CSV files.
* **Backup & Restore:** Create backups of the current data and restore from a backup file.
* **Reporting:** Generate various small reports, like student transcripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Java Stuff Used

This project demonstrates a wide range of modern and core Java features:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Core concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism are used throughout.
* **Exception Handling:** Robust error management using `try-catch` blocks and custom exceptions.
* **File I/O:** Modern file reading and writing operations using Java NIO.2.
* **Java Streams API:** Efficiently process collections of data for filtering and transformations.
* **Date/Time API:** Manages dates and times using the `java.time` package.
* **Advanced Java Constructs:**
    * Interfaces and abstract classes for defining contracts and base behaviors.
    * Nested classes, including the use of the **Builder pattern**.
    * Enums with values and constructors for type-safe constants.
    * Lambda functions and functional interfaces for concise code.
* **Design Patterns:** Implements patterns like **Singleton** and **Builder** for robust and scalable architecture.
* **Recursion:** Utilized in specific parts of the application for solving complex problems.

## üìú A Small History of Java

* **1995:** Java 1.0 is first released by Sun Microsystems.
* **1997:** Java 1.1 adds key features like inner classes and JDBC for database connectivity.
* **2004:** Java 5 (J2SE 5.0) is a major release, adding generics, annotations, and autoboxing.
* **2014:** Java 8 revolutionizes the language with lambdas, the Streams API, and a new Date/Time API.
* **2017:** Java 9 introduces the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) and the JShell REPL.
* **2021:** Java 17 (LTS) brings sealed classes and pattern matching for `instanceof`.

## üöÄ Java Setup

### 1. Install the JDK (Windows)
1.  Download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website.
2.  Follow the installation wizard's step-by-step instructions.
3.  Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation directory.
4.  Add the JDK's `bin` folder to your system's `PATH` variable.

### 2. Install Eclipse IDE
1.  Download the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** package.
2.  Extract the downloaded zip file and run `eclipse.exe`.
3.  Create a new Java project.
4.  Ensure the project's build path is configured to use the installed JDK (Java 8 or higher).
5.  Create your packages and classes within the project structure.

## üìù Example Use

Once the program is running, you will see a console menu. From there, you can perform various actions by selecting the corresponding option:

* Add new students and courses to the system.
* Register existing students into available courses.
* Enter grades for enrolled students and check their GPA.
* Print a student's academic transcript.
* Export data to a CSV file or import data from one.

* Perform a system-wide data backup or restore from a previous backup.
